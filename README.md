# Crisp-dm Model
<h3>This project is focused on predicting the expenses of the patients using Decision Tree Algorithm.</h3>
For doing this project we followed the <strong>CRISP-DM Model.<strong>
<ol>
  <li>In this project we build the crisp-dm model.</li>
  <li>Build the model using decision tree algorithm.</li>
  <li>Checking the accuracy of the model.</li>
  <li>Visualizing the decision tree.</li>
  <li>Increasing the accuracy of the model using boosting and bagging techniques.</li>
